Allows users to map URLs to keys and resolve them according to the user's browser capabilities\n * 2. Loads the resources and transforms them into assets that developers understand.\n * 3. Caches the assets and provides a way to access them.\n * 4. Allow developers to unload assets and clear the cache.\n *\n * It also has a few advanced features:\n * 1. Allows developers to provide a manifest upfront of all assets and help manage them via 'bundles'.\n * 2. Allows users to background load assets. Shortening (or eliminating) load times and improving UX. With this feature,\n * in-game loading bars can be a thing of the past!\n *\n * ### Assets Loading\n *\n * Do not be afraid to load things multiple times - under the hood, it will NEVER load anything more than once.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * ```js\n * import { Assets } from 'pixijs/browser';\n *\n * promise1 = Assets.load('bunny.png')\n * promise2 = Assets.load('bunny.png')\n *\n * // promise1 === promise2\n * ```\n *\n * Here both promises will be the same. Once resolved... Forever resolved! It makes for really easy resource management!\n *\n * Out of the box it supports the following files:\n * - textures (avif, webp, png, jpg, gif)\n * - sprite sheets (json)\n * - bitmap fonts (xml, fnt, txt)\n * - web fonts (ttf, woff, woff2)\n * - json files (json)\n * - text files (txt)\n *\n * More types can be added fairly easily by creating additional loader parsers.\n *\n * ### Textures\n * - Textures are loaded as ImageBitmap on a worker thread where possible.\n * Leading to much less janky load + parse times.\n * - By default, we will prefer to load AVIF and WebP image files if you specify them.\n * But if the browser doesn't support AVIF or WebP we will fall back to png and jpg.\n * - Textures can also be accessed via Texture.from(...) and now use this asset manager under the hood!\n * - Don't worry if you set preferences for textures that don't exist (for example you prefer 2x resolutions images\n *  but only 1x is available for that texture, the Asset manager will pick that up as a fallback automatically)\n *\n * #### Sprite sheets\n * - It's hard to know what resolution a sprite sheet is without loading it first, to address this\n * there is a naming convention we have added that will let Pixi understand the image format and resolution\n * of the spritesheet via its file name:\n *\n * `my-spritesheet{resolution}.{imageFormat}.json`\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * `my-spritesheet@2x.webp.json` // 2x resolution, WebP sprite sheet\n * `my-spritesheet@0.5x.png.json` // 0.5x resolution, png sprite sheet\n *\n * This is optional! You can just load a sprite sheet as normal.\n * This is only useful if you have a bunch of different res / formatted spritesheets.\n *\n * ### Fonts\n * Web fonts will be loaded with all weights.\n * It is possible to load only specific weights by doing the following:\n *\n * ```js\n * import { Assets } from 'pixijs/browser';\n *\n * // Load specific weights..\n * await Assets.load({\n *     data: {\n *         weights: ['normal'], // Only loads the weight\n *     },\n *     src: `outfit.woff2`,\n * });\n *\n * // Load everything...\n * await Assets.load(`outfit.woff2`);\n * ```\n *\n * ### Background Loading\n * Background loading will load stuff for you passively behind the scenes. To minimize jank,\n * it will only load one asset at a time. As soon as a developer calls `Assets.load(...)` the\n * background loader is paused and requested assets are loaded as a priority.\n * Don't worry if something is in there that's already loaded, it will just get skipped!\n *\n * You still need to call `Assets.load(...)` to get an asset that has been loaded in the background.\n * It's just that this promise will resolve instantly if the asset\n * has already been loaded.\n *\n * ### Manifest and Bundles\n * - Manifest is a JSON file that contains a list of all assets and their properties.\n * - Bundles are a way to group assets together.\n *\n * ```js\n * import { Assets } from 'pixijs/browser';\n *\n * // Manifest Example\n * const manifest = {\n *     bundles: [\n *         {\n *             name: 'load-screen',\n *             assets: [\n *                 {\n *                     name: 'background',\n *                     srcs: 'sunset.png',\n *                 },\n *                 {\n *                     name: 'bar',\n *                     srcs: 'load-bar.{png,webp}',\n *                 },\n *             ],\n *         },\n *         {\n *             name: 'game-screen',\n *             assets: [\n *                 {\n *                     name: 'character',\n *                     srcs: 'robot.png',\n *                 },\n *                 {\n *                     name: 'enemy',\n *                     srcs: 'bad-guy.png',\n *                 },\n *             ],\n *         },\n *     ]\n * };\n *\n * await Asset.init({ manifest });\n *\n * // Load a bundle...\n * loadScreenAssets = await Assets.loadBundle('load-screen');\n * // Load another bundle...\n * gameScreenAssets = await Assets.loadBundle('game-screen');\n * ```\n * @example\n * import { Assets } from 'pixijs/browser';\n *\n * const bunny = await Assets.load('bunny.png');\n */\nexport class AssetsClass\n{\n    /** the resolver to map various urls */\n    public resolver: Resolver;\n    /**\n     * The loader, loads stuff!\n     * @type {PIXI.AssetLoader}\n     */\n    public loader: Loader;\n    /**\n     * The global cache of all assets within PixiJS\n     * @type {PIXI.Cache}\n     */\n    public cache: typeof Cache;\n\n    /** takes care of loading assets in the background */\n    private readonly _backgroundLoader: BackgroundLoader;\n\n    private _detections: FormatDetectionParser[] = [];\n\n    private _initialized = false;\n\n    constructor()\n    {\n        this.resolver = new Resolver();\n        this.loader = new Loader();\n        this.cache = Cache;\n\n        this._backgroundLoader = new BackgroundLoader(this.loader);\n        this._backgroundLoader.active = true;\n\n        this.reset();\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Best practice is to call this function before any loading commences\n     * Initiating is the best time to add any customization to the way things are loaded.\n     *\n     * you do not need to call this for the Asset class to work, only if you want to set any initial properties\n     * @param options - options to initialize the Asset manager with\n     */\n    public async init(options: AssetInitOptions = {}): Promise<void>\n    {\n        if (this._initialized)\n        {\n            // #if _DEBUG\n            console.warn('[Assets]AssetManager already initialized, did you load before calling this Asset.init()?');\n            // #endif\n\n            return;\n        }\n\n        this._initialized = true;\n\n        if (options.basePath)\n        {\n            this.resolver.basePath = options.basePath;\n        }\n\n        if (options.manifest)\n        {\n            let manifest = options.manifest;\n\n            if (typeof manifest === 'string')\n            {\n                manifest = await this.load<ResolverManifest>(manifest) as ResolverManifest;\n            }\n\n            this.resolver.addManifest(manifest);\n        }\n\n        const resolutionPref =  options.texturePreference?.resolution ?? 1;\n        const resolution = (typeof resolutionPref === 'number') ?
